# Polyp Segmentation Using U-Net

In this project, the implementation of U-Net is carried out for polyps segmentation on colonoscopy images.  The model made has a good performance in segmenting polyps.  
Some of the metrics used to assess the performance of the created models including:

-   Intersection over Union (IoU) = 
- Accuracy = 97.524 
- Recall = 81.790
- Precision = 89.914
- F1-Score = 85.660
